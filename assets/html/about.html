        <h3>Starting in Northern California...</h3> In the middle of the 1980's, Computers were not a way of life, and phones were still attached to walls. I took an early interest in reading, dinosaurs, & math, and I thoroughly enjoyed the monochromatic computers in labs at school. We had a PC that ran on DOS and was good for programming in Visual Basic, but best for Tetris (Mom ALWAYS had the high score). When I was in elementary school, my dad bought an Apple II which we connected to the dial-up internet and waited for flame gifs to load.
      </p><p>
        We moved to the Silicon Valley when it had more fields than condos. I took a real interest in science and especially cooking. It was the perfect feedback loop where I was able to put the scientific method into practice, and then evaluate how successful or problematic the results were. By the end of high school I was playing sports, maxing out my AP classes, and cooking dinner 4 nights a week. Computing was inherent to the educational experience, and I took keyboarding classes and made a pretty fly myspace page.
      </p> <p>
        At the beginning of college at UC Davis, I thought I was going to be a Mechanical Engineer. I did it for a year, learning MATLAB and checking off prerequisites, but I was conflicted. I felt capable, but lacked motivation. I wanted something I could sink my teeth into, so in the fall of my sophomore year, I registered for a Food Science course: "Intro to Beer & Brewing", at which point, I fell down the rabbit hole. At about the same time, I joined "The Facebook" so Marky Z could stare at me from the header. 
      </p> <p>
        Food Science was the perfect union of technical complexity, science, and actual food. I could take the lessons learned during the day and cook them up for dinner that evening. Because it was college, I picked the Fermentation emphasis, because beer, wine, and cheese of course! I figured if I didn't get a food job, my fallback could be biochemistry. The coursework was diverse, and I learned statistics, sensory science, and microbiology. I was lucky enough to work at a brewery in England, optimizing brewing run-times & efficency, and I did a study abroad program in Holland, netting a year of my life in Europe.
      </p> <p>
        With degree in hand and debt on my books, I started working. My first role was at MillerCoors in a mind-bogglingly large brewery in a role similar to the previous brewery: increase efficency in both speed as well as sugar extraction on a scale where 1% was literally worth millions. I found that I enjoyed a smaller, hands-on approach and decided to go my own way. I wanted a brewery and/or restaurant of my own, and started gaining experience to that end.
      </p> <p>
        To build the perfect business, I would need experience in the industry. I spent years working as a chef, brewer, server, bartender, and caterer. I did a stint of market research as a beer brand ambassador. I monetized a Facebook page with mild success. I ran the west coast operations of a lifestyle brand. I renovated a restaurant with the hopes of building a brewery, until money and patience ran out. I threw parties and built kegerators for tech companies. All of this helped me launch a craft beer sports bar, BuzzWorks.
      </p> <p>
        BuzzWorks was a blank slate - A warehouse with potential in the heart of San Francisco's SoMa district. I welcomed a stable project which would utilize all the skills & experience I had worked so hard to gain. In addition to beer & food, I was in charge of operations, marketing, and everything digital. We were a small team with big goals, and we spent countless hours solving problems, hosting parties, and building relationships.
      </p> <p>
        Today, I find myself a married father. While I'm still passionate about fermentation ond food, I would like to apply my skills and idiosynchracies to developing something new and exciting. While I have only scratched the surface, I have always been interested in figuring out how things work. Mechanically, when things break, I carefully take them apart until the solution presents itself. While coding is more abstract, the fundamentals are the same. Thank you for being a part of my journey, and if you have any questions for me, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:realferalxanderyell@gmail.com">email me.</a>
