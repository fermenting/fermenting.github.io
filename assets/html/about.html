<h1>About Lyle</h1>

<div>
    I'm glad you're here, I'd like you to check out my portfolio. I started out cooking meals as a kid, which led me to
    study Food Science at the University of California, Davis. My passion to be unique led me to choose a beer brewing
    emphasis when I was getting degree, and I have brewed countless beers, as well as kombucha & ciders.

    I maintained a passion for cooking, as it is the perfect creative outlet. I enjoy creating whenever possible, and I
    appreciate good design. I have always used computers in my personal & professional life, and as I build developer
    skills, I'm amazed at the world of possibility. I love the juxtaposition of freedom with specificity.

    I currently run BuzzWorks, a craft beer bar in San Francisco. Digitally, I'm responsible for the website, as well
    as a myriad of systems like SmartTab (our Point-of-Sale) & Untappd, a beer social network that is able to display
    digital & print menus.
